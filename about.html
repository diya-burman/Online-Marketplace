      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this platform is to provide a detailed and seamless experience for buying, selling, 
        and bidding on products through our online marketplace. This document serves as a reference 
        for the development and execution of the system throughout its lifecycle.

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Our online marketplace system offers a secure and efficient environment where users can register 
        as buyers or sellers. Sellers can upload and list their products for direct sale or auction, while buyers 
        can explore, view details, and participate in real-time auctions by placing bids. The platform ensures 
        dynamic bidding with instant updates to maintain fairness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond core functionalities, we provide secure payment processing to safeguard transactions. 
        Buyers can track their purchases and bids, while sellers manage their listings and sales. Admins 
        oversee platform activities, manage users, and generate detailed reports to monitor the platform's 
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create an intuitive, user-friendly, and reliable platform that promotes efficient online 
        buying, selling, and bidding. We focus on delivering a highly engaging user experience with 
        real-time responsiveness and clear, easy-to-navigate interfaces.
